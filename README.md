# Task 2 – Cyber Awareness Website (Cyber Raksha)

This is my submission for Task 2 of the Prompt Engineering Internship at Future Interns.

I created a no-code website named *Cyber Raksha* using Dorik AI.  
It promotes cybersecurity awareness — especially for women and students.

### 🔐 What the Website Covers:
- Password protection tips
- Phishing and scam awareness
- Digital hygiene and safety rules
- Privacy best practices
